  "name": "Project 2 Invoice Scraping",
  "description": "In this project, you will develop an automation for a process that will scrape relevant data from invoices for further processing. The Robot will read through emails and download the invoices received in the form of an email attachment as a PDF. It will extract specific data and store those values in an Excel spreadsheet and a subset of values will be uploaded to the Orchestrator Queue. And finally, when you're finished, the robot will email the spreadsheet to you.",
